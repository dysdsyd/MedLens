# MedLens 
Scientists and researchers are faced with arduous task of perusing through research work and retrieving useful information. The database for the same is insanely large and humanly impossible to manually and diligently go through all of them. Having the most trivial knowledge about their interest areas, they seek to know more by asking factoid questions and getting a deep dive into the rich research text. The problem at hand intends to answer questions asked given a text (uploaded or searched), or using therapeutic entities specified.
